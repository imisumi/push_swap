## About ##

This repository contains a solution for the Push Swap project at [42 School](https://42.fr). The goal of the project is to write two programs, `push_swap` and `checker`,  that can sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations.

| Operation | Description |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| `sa` | swap A - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack A |
| `sb` | swap B - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack B |
| `ss` | `sa` and `sb` at the same time |
| `pa` | push A - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of A |
| `pb` | push B - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of B |
| `ra` | rotate A - shift up all elements of stack A by 1. The first element becomes the last one |
| `rb` | rotate B - shift up all elements of stack B by 1. The first element becomes the last one |
| `rr` | `ra` and `rb` at the same time |
| `rra` | reverse rotate A - shift down all elements of stack A by 1. The last element becomes the first one |
| `rrb` | reverse rotate B - shift down all elements of stack B by 1. The last element becomes the first one |
| `rrr` | `rra` and `rrb` at the same time |
